We have created chess board, without animation.
    for section background an image is used.
    in html we have 1 main centered div (board), it contains 64 squares (each square is div), we also have chess pieces in 32 divs. there is also numerical symbols on left and bottom sides of board.
    also there is profile infos of chess players.
